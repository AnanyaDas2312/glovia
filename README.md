## 1. Inspiration
Since the internet has bloomed in India enormously, the use of technology and smartphones are widely spread even to remote rural locations. 
But harrowingly, even in this new progressive era, the talk of menstrual hygiene and periods are still a taboo and hush hush. 
With the help of Glovia, our team provides the platform and tools which will cater to the needs of every woman in this important phase of their life and aims to make menstrual hygiene accessible to each and every woman in every nook of India. 

## 2. What it does(Problem Statement)
 A website that helps women track their menstrual cycle, Pamper booth that offers some unique feature to cater mood swings, Gynecologist help for medical assistance, Menstrual Blog for creating awareness about menstrual health and hygiene, a Women intimate hygiene shop providing quality products and a discussion forum with video calling feature. 
 This website provides all the necessary help and assistance that a woman needs in this phase of their monthly cycle.
## 3. Features 
- Period Tracker: Our Period tracker helps women to keep a track of their menstrual cycle and also offers them to edit their cycle or period length. 
- Pamper Booth: As we know during periods, women go through a lot of hormonal changes which leads to mood swings, having cramps etc. To cater to this need, we’ve offered our customers an PamperBooth which offers two unique features:                                                
Mood based playlists: Spotify playlists are generated based on the mood you have for the day.                                                                                      
Notifying your loved ones: An email with instructions on how they can take care of their loved one will be sent to that email address.
- Discussion Forum: Our team has come up with a Discussion Forum, a custom built API, which is powered by machine learning where profane words have been censored. This feature will help connect women and share their views and thoughts with each other.
- Menstrual Blog: Awareness comes with knowledge. To create and increase awareness among our users, we have built another API, a Menstrual Blog, which grabs articles regarding menstrual hygiene and many others.
